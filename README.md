# Memories
Memories is a web application I created as part of my journey in full-stack development. It's a hands-on learning project that showcases my skills in building both the frontend and backend of a web application. 

## Project Flowchart

1. Users can view a list of existing posts on the homepage.
2. They have the option to create a new post by filling out a form with a title, description, image, and tags.
3. Posts can be liked by users.
4. Users can edit their own posts.
5. Users can delete their own posts.

## Technologies I Used

- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **State Management:** Redux
- **Deployment:** Heroku (backend)


## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. In the server directory, change the `CONNECTION_URL` in `index.js` to your MongoDB Atlas driver connection URL.

2. run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the app
